AND101 Project 6 - CYOAPI Part 2: RecyclerView Edition

Submitted by: **Wisdom Ariagbofo**

Time spent: **12** hours spent in total.

**Summary**

**Random Pokemon Characters** is an android app that displays a scrollable list of characters from the pokemon API.

If I had to describe this project in three (3) emojis, they would be:üòäüòÅüòÉ

**Application Features**

The following REQUIRED features are completed:

- [x] Make an API call to an API of your choice using AsyncHTTPClient
- [x] Implement a RecyclerView to display a list of entries from the API
- [x] Display at least three (3) pieces of data for each RecyclerView item

The following STRETCH features are implemented:

- [ ] Add a UI element for the user to interact with API further
- [x] Show a `Toast` or `Snackbar` when an item is clicked
- [x] Add item dividers with `DividerItemDecoration`

The following EXTRA features are implemented:

- [x] I added a suitable icon image to add to the applications aesthetic appeal when it is launched.

**Notes**

I learned how to use recycler views to create more dynamic applications which fetch and display data from an Application Programming Interface(API).
